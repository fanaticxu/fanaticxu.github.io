                      Q: How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild? <br>
                      A: I think it's a good idea to built the skeleton of a web, then add layout and functions little by little. Leave the unknown thing with placeholder first. It can save me a lot of time from figuring everything out.
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                      Q: What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?<br>
                      A: I think meditation is a method to help you empty your mind and become relaxed and peaceful             
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                      Q: What new things have you learnt about meditation?<br>
                      A: It's also a way to grow your attention by keeping bringing your wandering attention back. Like physical exercise, it's exercise for your mind.              
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                      Q: Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?<br>
                      A: Thanks for the detailed description, I'm able to handle almost any situation such as distraction and itchy when doing meditation. I will try to do it regularly and see if any good things come up.              
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Q: Any other musings?<br>
                      A: Is it some kind of self-hypnotic suggestionï¼Œa way to hack into our own subconscious.

                      <ul>Q: How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</ul>
                      <ul>A: I think it's a good idea to built the skeleton of a web, then add layout and functions little by little. Leave the unknown thing with placeholder first. It can save me a lot of time from figuring everything out.</ul>
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                      <ul>Q: What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</ul>
                      <ul>A: I think meditation is a method to help you empty your mind and become relaxed and peaceful</ul>             
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                      <ul>Q: What new things have you learnt about meditation?</ul>
                      <ul>A: It's also a way to grow your attention by keeping bringing your wandering attention back. Like physical exercise, it's exercise for your mind. </ul>             
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                      <ul>Q: Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</ul>
                      <ul>A: Thanks for the detailed description, I'm able to handle almost any situation such as distraction and itchy when doing meditation. I will try to do it regularly and see if any good things come up. </ul>             
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <ul>Q: Any other musings?</ul>
                      <ul>A: Is it some kind of self-hypnotic suggestionï¼Œa way to hack into our own subconscious.</ul>

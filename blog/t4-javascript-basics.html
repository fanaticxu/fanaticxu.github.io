                       Q: How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?<br>
                       A: JavaScript is much more fun to me. Using JavaScript we can make page interactive now.

                   <p> 
                       Q: Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.<br>
                       A: Control flow is like a schedule, we list a plan for one day and do it in sequence. Loops is like repeat the same thing until meet the preset conditions. Every morning my son is weaking me up. he will loop his call action and the loop finish when I get up.
                       <p class="text-warp">
                           for (var strength = 0; strength < tolerance; strength++ ) { <br>
                            randomActionFrom(yelling, bumping); <br>
                            } <br>
                            retrun getUp(); <br>
                         </p>

                   </p>
                   <p> 
                       Q: Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.<br>
                       A: Data in arrays are ordered. We can access data by using indexs.
                       Data in objects are not ordered. We can access objects through properties. 
                   </p>
                   <p> 
                       Q: Explain what functions are and why they are useful.<br>
                       A: We put a set of control flow together and give a name. It's become a function. We can call this function whenever we need to do the same thing.  It's avoid repeat the same code.

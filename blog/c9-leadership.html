                        What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?<br>
                        I had a project manager when I was in Rohde-Schwarz. He seems have a low haha point. We feel happy when work with him. Even if we experience some hard situations, we don't feel pressure from him. He always face the most of the press himself. He also work harder than us, influence us with the action not the words. So we are willing to work for him, it's such a great working experience.

                        Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?<br>
                        I may not need to do this practice. I remember my father told me to think objectively when I was in primary school. So I always think in this pattern. Now I feel like I'm kind of a yea-man. Because I may care about others feeling too much.

                        Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?<br>
                        I cannot do this either, bacause I cannot recall any difficult things. I always trade them as a life experience and then let them be. So every time my wife and I have a fight, She can always point my bad in the past, however I cannot remember any fault she made...

                        How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?<br>
                        I understand that how uncretainty interfere your coding work. If I feel it's too hard and I can do it. I probably wont even start do it. Now I found a good solution. That is just do what you can do first and tell yourself "see, I can do this right?" then try to push yourself to achieve a harder feature and praising yourself again. By taking small steps and keep giving positive feedback, I finished the calculator and snake game apps. Which I thought I can't do it at first.
                        <br>
                        Regarding to the autonomy, I'm going to share some idea of how do I start a efficient self-study. First one is study with others, when I study at the campus I feel that it's impolite to eat or walkaround or watch fun video, I can only study.
                        Another trick is start self-study with a ceremony. I gradually started wearing a hat before study at home. I told myself "Now I locked all of my idea inside of my brain, no thoughts can run away, they will all serve my study now." Then I become more concentrated than usual.

                        Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)<br>
                        I'll do it in phase 1.

                      Q: When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?<br>
                      A: I got frustrated when I found the project is so complicated. That I didn't dare to try it. Now I find no matter how complicated it is, it is made up of a little pieces of code. And I can do it little by little.

                      Q: How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?<br>
                      A: It reminds me of my first year of marriage. We fought almost one year just for some tiny stuipt reasons. Now when I look back, it's so important if I could have the sacred stop for a sec before blow up. Now I did it. A deep breath with tolerance and understanding will make the life much easier.

                      Q: How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?<br>
                      A: Pleasure can bring you happiness but cannot last long. Do your work as a hobby is an ideal mode. You are able to do the work happily for the most time of your daily life. Purpose is the source of your motivation.

                      From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,<br>
                      Q: What are your core values? <br>
                      A: Responsible and reliable, care about others, logical and rational <br>
                      Q: What do you stand for?    <br>
                      A: I stand for special education instead of general. Help people build their own self-study model, encourage them to try new things, let them decide what they passion about and what they want to learn.

                    Q: How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?<br>
                    A: By doing this meditation you are able to transfer your negative emotion into physiological sensations. Then you can watch them objectively and let them be. In general, treat the failure as the event with high probability and thankful for every single success you achieved.

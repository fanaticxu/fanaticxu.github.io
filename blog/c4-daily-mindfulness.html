                      Q: What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?<br>
                      A: I cannot find person who can do 'mindfulness conversation' with me now.
                      But it reminded me when I was in college, I have some overnight talking with two friends. We paid attention to each other. Exchanged thoughts and idears. It literally took a whole night. That was perfect experiences so even now I can still remember. I guess it is a mindfulness conversation.

                      Q: Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?<br>
                      A: 1. Do less than I can. Find my own pace that I feel comfortable. 2. Award myself if achieve some records. 3. Take at least one breath a day.

                      Q: Any other musings?<br>
                      A: I feel like my meta-attention growth. I read this chapter faster than before. I was aware when my attention wander away and I was able to bring it back consciously.

                      Q: What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?<br>
                      A: They are basically the same thing. It's like observe your emotion objectively.

                  <p> 
                      Q: Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?<br>
                      A: Tried body scan, I'm able to detect the current status of each part of my body. And when the emotion bring in, I can notice the physical response of my body.            
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Q: What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?<br>
                      A: Transform 'I feel angry' to 'I experience anger in my body' is a great solution to control your emotion. But don't go too far, I think it's also a way to get rid of your human side. So balance is important.

                        Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?<br>
                        When others are in trouble and need help, it's importent to feel their feeling first. And try to help without hurt their feelings. In this case you may gain trust and sincerity.

                        Try empathic listening - how did it go?<br>
                        I'll try it when I meet my friends.

                        How did you find the loving kindness meditation?<br>
                        First I got calm down and relax. When I wish somebody I care be well and happy. When I imagine the picture that they are happy. I feel happy.

                    Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    1. Got blocked on a simple problem. <br>
                    2. Solved a problem in an elegant way In both cases:
                   </p>
                   
                   <p class="font-italic text-sm-left"> 
                        What was the problem? <br>
                        What problem solving techniques did you use? <br>
                        How did you feel throughout the process? <br>
                        What did you learn? <br>

                   <p> 
                        I met so many problem during work and study. I just cannot address one.
                        Usually when I have a problem, I always google first and it can solve 90% of them.
                        Otherwise I will ask my colleagues. It's also a quick way to get the answer. We used to have short audio conference on every Monday. We update the current progress, blocking issues and new ideas. It's a good chance to unblock your problems by listen to others ideas.
